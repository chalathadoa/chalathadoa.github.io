            </div>
            <div class="abt-middle">
                <p>Hello! I'm Udkul Roghodan, a fresh graduate in Computer Science with a strong passion for web development. My journey into the tech world began with a deep curiosity about how websites are built, which quickly turned into a passion for creating user-friendly and functional web applications. During my studies and internships, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Codeigniter, Laravel, gaining a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. For me, learning is an ongoing journey, and I thrive on the challenge of keeping up with the latest technologies and industry trends. My passion for problem-solving, coupled with my dedication to delivering high-quality work, drives me to excel in every project I undertake.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="abt-right">
                <p>My project experience includes designing user interfaces during my internship, building a company-profile website, building an e-commerce website using wordpress, develop a clonning website of <a href="https://8bacus.com/">8Bacus</a> as a work test and developing a comprehensive information system for a Muslimah dormitory as my biggest project so far. This dormitory project involved creating a system with five different user roles and implementing QR code for attendance, providing me with a real experience in creating practical, user-friendly solutions. I'm eager to continue growing my skills and take on new challenges in web development.</p>

                    <h3>Develop Information System Website</h3>
                    <p>I build an information system website at Amalia House of Muslimah for my thesis. The web has 5 different roles and multi-features such managing users, events, assesment report, classes, qr-attendance, etc. The website also implement data mining through student's classification using DTRee Algorithm. I learned a lot from building this website. When our efforts hit a dead end or encounter errors, it doesn't mean we come up empty-handed, at the very least, we discover that path was the wrong one. <a href="https://endeavor.my.id" target="_blank">Here's the link.</a> And feel free to contact me if you wanna see the detail.</p>

                    <h3>UI Design: Pharmacy Website</h3>
                    <p>In the end of 2022, I took part in an internship at a company called Disty Teknologi Indonesia as a Web Developer where the final project was to build a website for pharmacists to sell medicine. My role in this project was as a UI designer and front-end developer. The website has 2 roles admin and the pharmacist. It's a non-register website, so the pharmacist account will be added from admin. I've learn a lot designing UI for website in this project. <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/5BlCdHDnI9fOGWODvIG18H/FP_Disty_Apotik?t=A6hotJewjjIyfZD0-1" target="_blank">Here's my UI design for the project.</a> I also have some UI design for android app for my PKM, <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/DjLBmVWKML1VIiTmqA1L2n/go-eco?node-id=4-0&t=MSmiCjAfUrOSIEKl-1" target="_blank">Here it is.</a></p>

                    <h3>Create Company Profile Website</h3>
                    <p>In my free time, I took a web development course by RevoU. The final project of this course was to build a company profile website with a predetermined wireframe. We could modify the website as long as it had the same content that had been determined. I built this website with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without using any libraries or frameworks. This project helped me deepen my understanding of front-end development and reinforced my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web pages from scratch. <a href="https://chalathadoa.github.io/RevoU/">Here's my exciting creation.</a></p>

                    <h3>Build E-commerce Website Using Wordpress</h3>
                    <p>While waiting for interviews, I crafted the FelineFits Co. e-commerce project provided invaluable hands-on experience that has significantly contributed to my growth as a web developer in just 5 days. This project enhanced my technical skills in WordPress, theme customization, and responsive design. Additionally, the project allowed me to explore the creative aspects of web development, such as branding and crafting a cohesive aesthetic for a niche market. Overall, this project solidified my confidence in delivering high-quality web solutions and reinforced my passion for building engaging and functional websites. <a href="https://tokochalathadoa.my.id/">Great to show you my project.</a></p>

                    <h3>Build A Clonning Web of 8Bacus</h3>
                    <p>For a job test, I was tasked with creating an exact clone of the <a href="https://8bacus.com/">8Bacus website</a> within a tight deadline of just two days. To challenge myself and expand my skill set, I chose to work with Laravel and Tailwind CSS, technology I had never used before. Despite the time constraints, I successfully recreated the website to match the original design and functionality, allowing me to not only master new technologies but also improve my problem-solving abilities under pressure. <a href="https://github.com/chalathadoa/8bacus-test">Proud to show you the result of my efforts.</a></p>
