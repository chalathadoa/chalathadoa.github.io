                <p>Hello! I'm Udkul Roghodan, a fresh graduate in Computer Science with a strong passion for web development. My journey into the tech world began with a deep curiosity about how websites are built, which quickly turned into a passion for creating user-friendly and functional web applications. During my studies and internships, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Codeigniter and Laravel, gaining a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development. For me, learning is an ongoing journey, and I thrive on the challenge of keeping up with the latest technologies and industry trends. My passion for problem-solving, coupled with my dedication to delivering high-quality work, drives me to excel in every project I undertake.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="abt-right">
                <p>My project experience includes designing user interfaces during my internship, building a company-profile website, building an e-commerce website using wordpress, develop a clonning website of <a href="https://8bacus.com/">8Bacus</a> as a work test and developing a comprehensive information system for a Muslimah dormitory as my biggest project so far. This dormitory project involved creating a system with five different user roles and implementing QR code for attendance, providing me with a real experience in creating practical, user-friendly solutions. I'm eager to continue growing my skills and take on new challenges in web development.</p>

                    <p>In the end of 2022, I took part in an internship at a company called Disty Teknologi Indonesia as a Web Developer where the final project was to build a website for pharmacists to sell medicine. My role in this project was as a UI designer and front-end developer. The website has 2 roles, admin and the pharmacist.

                    <p>In my free time, I took a web development course by RevoU. The final project of this course was to build a company profile website with a predetermined wireframe. The exciting part is we could modify the website as long as it had the same content that had been determined, so I've a lot of fun designing website that I want. I built this website with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without using any libraries nor frameworks. This project helped me deepen my understanding of front-end development and reinforced my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web pages from scratch. <a href="https://chalathadoa.github.io/RevoU/">Here's my exciting creation.</a></p>

                    <p>This is one of my job test that I'm thrilled to share. I was tasked with creating an exact clone of the <a href="https://8bacus.com/">8Bacus website</a> within a tight deadline of just two days. To challenge myself and expand my skill set, I chose to work with Laravel and Tailwind CSS, technologies I had never used before.

                    <h3>A Project: Investment App</h3>
                    <p>I built an Investment Savings Calculator that dynamically calculates investment outcomes based on specific savings data. This project was particularly exciting for me as it allowed me to dive into new technology, specifically working with a JavaScript framework for the first time. I developed the backend using Express.js and the frontend using Vue.js (Nuxt.js), gaining substantial hands-on experience in creating RESTful APIs and effectively bridging the gap between backend and frontend systems. This project was an incredible learning experience, helping me enhance my skills in web development and API integration. <a href="https://github.com/chalathadoa/invest-app">Delighted to unveil the fruits of my labor.

                    <h3>Role-Based Blogging Website</h3>
                    <p>I developed a Role-Based Blog Application using Laravel and Tailwind CSS, designed to manage content with distinct user roles. The app features two roles: Admin and Author. The Admin has full control, including the ability to manage users and posts (CRUD operations), while the Author is limited to managing their own posts. This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of role-based access control and user management within a Laravel framework. <a href="https://github.com/chalathadoa/blog-app">Excited to share the outcome of my work.
