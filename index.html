                <p>Hello! I'm Udkul Roghodan, a fresh graduate in Computer Science with a strong passion for web development. My journey into the tech world began with a deep curiosity about how websites are built, which quickly turned into a passion for creating user-friendly and functional web applications. During my studies and internships, I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks such as Codeigniter, gaining a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end development.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="abt-right">
                <p>My project experience includes designing user interfaces during my internship, building a company-profile website, and developing a comprehensive information system for a Muslimah dormitory as my biggest project so far. This dormitory project involved creating a system with five different user roles and implementing QR code for attendance, providing me with a real experience in creating practical, user-friendly solutions. I'm eager to continue growing my skills and take on new challenges in web development.</p>

                <h3>UI Design: Pharmacy Website</h3>
                <p>In the end of 2022, I took part in an internship at a company called Disty Teknologi Indonesia as a Web Developer where the final project was to build a website for pharmacists to sell medicine. My role in this project was as a UI designer and front-end developer. The website has 2 roles admin and the pharmacist. It's a non-register website, so the pharmacist account will be added from admin. I've learn a lot designing UI for website in this project. <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/5BlCdHDnI9fOGWODvIG18H/FP_Disty_Apotik?t=A6hotJewjjIyfZD0-1" target="_blank">Here's my UI design for the project.</a> I also have some UI design for android app for my PKM, <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/DjLBmVWKML1VIiTmqA1L2n/go-eco?node-id=4-0&t=MSmiCjAfUrOSIEKl-1" target="_blank">Here it is.</a></p>

                <h3>Develop System Information Website</h3>
                <p>I build a system information website for my thesis. The web has 5 different roles and multi-features such managing users, events, assesment report, classes, qr-attendance, etc. The website also implement data mining through student's classification using DTRee Algorithm. I learned a lot from building this website. When our efforts hit a dead end or encounter errors, it doesn't mean we come up empty-handed, at the very least, we discover that path was the wrong one. <a href="https://endeavor.my.id" target="_blank">Here's the link.</a> And feel free to contact me if you wanna see the detail.</p>

                <h3>Create Company Profile Website</h3>
                <p>In my free time, I took a web development course by RevoU. The final project of this course was to build a company profile website with a predetermined wireframe. We could modify the website as long as it had the same content that had been determined. I built this website with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without using any libraries or frameworks. This project helped me deepen my understanding of front-end development and reinforced my ability to create responsive, user-friendly web pages from scratch. <a href="https://chalathadoa.github.io/RevoU/">Here's my exciting creation.</a></p>
